Package hmetrics is an opinionate, simple to plumb, implementation of Heroku's
Go language metrics, which plays nicely with logs.  Heroku's implementation is
simpler if you don't want to log or have sane exponential capped backoff.
This package is simpler to use if you do.

We deliberately support neither nil logging callbacks nor callbacks being able
to cancel metrics collection via their return code.  We make a number of checks
before spawning the go-routine which does metrics posts and return those, so
the only errors afterwards will be context cancellation (your action), problems
collecting stats (should be transient) or HTTP errors posting to the endpoint,
which presumable will resolve at some point.  There's no documented guidance on
HTTP errors which indicate "service has had to move, abort and restart to
collect the new URL", so any analysis you might do in a callback is a guessing
game of little utility.

Just call Spawn() with your error-logging callback and handle the return values
from Spawn as you see fit.
